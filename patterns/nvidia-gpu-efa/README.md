# EKS Cluster w/ NVIDIA GPUs and EFA for Machine Learning

This pattern demonstrates an Amazon EKS Cluster with an EFA-enabled nodegroup that utilizes `p5.48xlarge` instances with H100 NVIDIA GPUs used in distributed, multi-node machine learning workloads.

The following components are demonstrated in this pattern:

- A "default" node group that supports addons and components that do not require GPUs nor EFA devices. Any pods that do not tolerate the taints of the GPU node group will be scheduled on instances within this node group.
- A node group of `p5.48xlarge` instances with
  - all x32 [EFA network interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html) enabled
  - provisioned within a placement group so that the instances are provisioned close to one another in a single availability zone that supports the instance type.
  - a common NVIDIA taint of `"nvidia.com/gpu:NoSchedule"` to ensure only the intended applications are allowed to run on the nodes created
  - two labels to identify that this nodegroup supports NVIDIA GPUs and EFA devices and allow pods to use node selectors with these labels
  - the NVME instance store volumes are mounted in a RAID-0 array to provide a single, large, high-performance storage volume for the GPU workloads
  - kubelet and containerd are configured to utilize the RAID-0 volume, allowing kubelet to discover the additional storage as ephemeral storage that can be utilized by pods
- A Helm chart deployment for the [NVIDIA device plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin) to expose and mount the GPUs provided by the instances to the pods that request them
- A Helm chart deployment for the EFA device plugin to expose and mount the EFA network interfaces provided by the instances to the pods that request them. Since the EFA network interfaces are only found on the instances that provide NVIDIA GPUs in this pattern, we do not apply an additional taint for the EFA network interfaces to avoid over-constraining.

## Code

```terraform hl_lines="23-25 31-68"
{% include  "../../patterns/nvidia-gpu-efa/eks.tf" %}
```

## Deploy

See [here](https://aws-ia.github.io/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/getting-started/#prerequisites) for the prerequisites and steps to deploy this pattern.

## Validate

!!! note

    The following steps are shown with `g5.8xlarge` for frugality. Values shown below will change based on the instance type selected (i.e. - `p5.48xlarge` has 8 GPUs and 32 EFA interfaces)

1. List the nodes by instance type:

    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes -o yaml | grep instance-type | grep node | grep -v f:
    ```

    ```text
    node.kubernetes.io/instance-type: g5.8xlarge
    node.kubernetes.io/instance-type: m5.large
    node.kubernetes.io/instance-type: m5.large
    node.kubernetes.io/instance-type: g5.8xlarge
    ```

    You should see two EFA-enabled (in this example `g5.8xlarge`) nodes in the list.

2. Deploy Kubeflow MPI Operator

    Kubeflow MPI Operator is required for running MPIJobs on EKS. We will use an MPIJob to test EFA.
    To deploy the MPI operator execute the following:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator/v0.3.0/deploy/v2beta1/mpi-operator.yaml
    ```

    ```text
    namespace/mpi-operator created
    customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/mpijobs.kubeflow.org created
    serviceaccount/mpi-operator created
    clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubeflow-mpijobs-admin created
    clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubeflow-mpijobs-edit created
    clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubeflow-mpijobs-view created
    clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/mpi-operator created
    clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/mpi-operator created
    deployment.apps/mpi-operator created
    ```

    In addition to deploying the operator, please apply a patch to the mpi-operator clusterrole
    to allow the mpi-operator service account access to `leases` resources in the `coordination.k8s.io` apiGroup.

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/aws-do-eks/main/Container-Root/eks/deployment/kubeflow/mpi-operator/clusterrole-mpi-operator.yaml
    ```

    ```text
    clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/mpi-operator configured
    ```

3. EFA test

    The results should shown that two EFA adapters are available (one for each worker pod)

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/aws-do-eks/main/Container-Root/eks/deployment/efa-device-plugin/test-efa.yaml
    ```

    ```text
    mpijob.kubeflow.org/efa-info-test created
    ```

    Once the test launcher pod enters status `Running` or `Completed`, see the test logs using the command below:

    ```sh
    kubectl logs -f $(kubectl get pods | grep launcher | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
    ```

    ```text
    Warning: Permanently added 'efa-info-test-worker-1.efa-info-test-worker.default.svc,10.11.13.224' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
    Warning: Permanently added 'efa-info-test-worker-0.efa-info-test-worker.default.svc,10.11.4.63' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

    ```

4. EFA NCCL test

    To run the EFA NCCL test please execute the following kubectl command:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/aws-do-eks/main/Container-Root/eks/deployment/efa-device-plugin/test-nccl-efa.yaml
    ```

    ```text
    mpijob.kubeflow.org/test-nccl-efa created
    ```

    Once the launcher pod enters `Running` or `Completed` state, execute the following to see the test logs:

    ```sh
    kubectl logs -f $(kubectl get pods | grep launcher | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
    ```

    ```text
    [1,0]<stdout>:test-nccl-efa-worker-0:21:21 [0] NCCL INFO NET/OFI Selected Provider is efa (found 1 nics)
    [1,0]<stdout>:test-nccl-efa-worker-0:21:21 [0] NCCL INFO Using network AWS Libfabric
    [1,0]<stdout>:NCCL version 2.12.7+cuda11.4
    ```

    Columns 8 and 12 in the output table show the in-place and out-of-place bus bandwidth calculated for the data size listed in column 1. In this case it is 3.13 and 3.12 GB/s respectively.
    Your actual results may be slightly different. The calculated average bus bandwidth is displayed at the bottom of the log when the test finishes after it reaches the max data size,
    specified in the mpijob manifest. In this result the average bus bandwidth is 1.15 GB/s.
